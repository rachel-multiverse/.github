# Rachel Multiverse

**One card game. Every platform ever made. Total madness.**

## What Is This?

We're implementing the Rachel card game on EVERY computing platform that exists. From the Fairchild Channel F (1976) to modern quantum computers. If it can compute, it must run Rachel.

## The Sacred Rules

- You must play if you can (no passing allowed)
- The protocol is 64 bytes
- Every platform behaves identically
- The cards are eternal

**Target: 200+ platforms**

## How To Contribute

1. Pick a platform (any platform)
2. Implement Rachel using [rachel-core](https://github.com/rachel-multiverse/rachel-core)
3. Follow the [protocol](https://github.com/rachel-multiverse/rachel-protocol) for networking
4. Create repo as `rachel-[platform]`
5. Submit PR to add to platform list
6. Lose sanity
7. Find glory

## The Convergence Event

**2026**: 100+ platforms playing simultaneously in one massive tournament.

## Quick Start

### Play Now (Terminal)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rachel-multiverse/rachel-terminal
cd rachel-terminal
make
./rachel_terminal
```

### Implement Your Own Platform
```bash
# 1. Get the rules
git clone https://github.com/rachel-multiverse/rachel-core

# 2. Copy rules.h and rules.c to your project

# 3. Implement UI for your platform

# 4. ??? 

# 5. Rachel runs on your toaster
```

## The Goal

Every computer that has ever existed should be able to play Rachel against every other computer. A Fairchild Channel F from 1976 should be able to play against an iPhone 15. This is insane. We're doing it anyway.

## Statistics

- Platforms Targeted: 200+
- Platforms Complete: 6
- Languages Planned: 100+
- Sanity Remaining: 0
- Regrets: 0

## The Motto

> "You must play if you can.
> You must port if you can.
> The protocol is sacred.
> The cards are eternal."
